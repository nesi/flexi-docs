# NeSI FlexiHPC User Guide Documentation

This is the content that hosts the site https://nesi.github.io/flexi-docs/

## File layout

### docs/

Location of markdown docs. File structure determines categories and sections. A section or category can be replaced by an index.md file, this will replace the default nav with a page.

### docs/assets

This is broken down into a few things, treat this as site assets like `css`, `images` or `files(pdfs etc)`


### docs/base_folder_name

This is normally the base folder structure that houses the markdown documents for that subject, example would be `docs/user-guides` houses all the user guides for flexi

### summary and index

These 2 files are used as the following

`index.md` is the base page for that section or group

`summary.md` is the nav structure for that section or group, if not supplied then the site will tile all markdown docs out
